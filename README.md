## Introduction
For this test, you will be free to use any king of libs. The goal is to give us an idea on how you think
what you know, how you understand problematics.

If you don't have the time to finish it, you can explain in the email how.

Good luck and have fun ;)
## Exercise 1 - Load CSV file
To begin you have to load a CSV file in database.
We must load this file with command line and through a web page.
## Exercise 2 - Create an API
You have to create an rest API where we can:

***GET***
* total amount donations
* total rewards quantity by project
* ... free to expose what you know

***POST/PUT/PATCH***
* donation linked to a user, reward, project
* user
* project

## Exercise 3 - Create a front application
You have to create one or multiple page to display what you loaded in database through the API.

Bonus: If possible try to use Vue.js
